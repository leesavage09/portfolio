            Tyne Tunnel is the most popular route for those driving to the North
            of England. The tunnel goes underneath the river Tyne and connects
            North and South Shields.

            A cashless free flow system was implemented in November 2021. The
            removal of barriers and physical payment booths required
            implementation of a web app payment system.

              Teach.io is a SaaS startup that enables people to turn their
              passions into careers through a state-of-the-art, custom-built,

              When I joined the project, teach.io was in MVP stage with a small
              number of beta testers. I worked on this project as a full-stack
              developer, adding new features such as Zoom and Zapier
              Integrations.

            Notinstagram is a pixel perfect MVP version of Instagram. I created
            notinstagram in my spare time to learn React and Ruby on Rails. It

            full stack aplication from scratch.

              Sailing knots 3D is an interactive app that teaches how to tie the
              most common sailing knots. Besides coding, I run the odd sailing
              course. While teaching students, I became aware of the fact that
              thereâ€™s no proper 3D app available for teaching sailing knots. I
              created this app in my spare time to better teach my students and
              to play around with Three.js.
